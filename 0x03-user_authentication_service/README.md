# 0x03. User Authentication Service

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a user authentication service using Flask. While industry best practices recommend using pre-built authentication modules like `Flask-User`, this project will guide you through implementing authentication mechanisms manually to gain a deeper understanding of how they work.

### Duration
- **Start date**: September 9, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End date**: September 13, 2024, 6:00 AM

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Declare API routes in a Flask application.
- Set and retrieve cookies.
- Extract data from HTTP request forms.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for different responses.

## Resources
To complete this project, you may find the following resources useful:
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Requests Module Documentation](https://docs.python-requests.org/)
- [List of HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

## Key Features
1. **API Route Declaration**: Learn how to set up routes in Flask to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
2. **Cookies Management**: Understand how to set and retrieve cookies from client-side requests.
3. **Form Data Retrieval**: Extract form data sent via HTTP requests using Flask’s request object.
4. **HTTP Status Codes**: Implement proper HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 400, 401) based on the API’s response logic.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Flask 2.0+**
